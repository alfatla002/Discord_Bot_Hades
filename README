# Hades Discord Bot

Slash-command driven Discord bot for playful utility commands and voice-enabled music playback.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Install [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on your system so it is available on the `PATH` (for example `pip install yt-dlp` or `brew install yt-dlp`).
3. Create a `.env` file that defines `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `GUILD_ID`, `GROQ_API_KEY`. Add `YOUTUBE_COOKIE` for restricted videos and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` / `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` to enable Spotify link lookups.
4. Register the commands with your guild:
   ```bash
   node commands/deploy-commands.js
   ```
5. Run the bot with `node commands/index.js`.

## Music Commands

The music subsystem uses `@discordjs/voice`, `yt-dlp`, `yt-search`, and optional Spotify lookups to resolve and stream tracks directly from YouTube.

- `/play <query or url>` — join your current voice channel and start playback from a YouTube URL, search YouTube when given plain text, or resolve Spotify track links to a matching YouTube source.
- `/skip` — skip the current track (requires being in the same voice channel as the bot).
- `/stop` — clear the queue and disconnect the bot.
- `/queue` — show what is currently playing plus the next 10 upcoming tracks.

The bot automatically leaves the channel once the queue finishes.

## Moderation Commands

- `/clear <count>` — bulk-delete up to 100 recent messages in the current channel.
- `/mute <member>` — applies a server-wide `Muted` role (auto-created) so the user cannot chat or speak.
- `/unmute <member>` — removes the Muted role.

You need appropriate Discord permissions (Manage Messages or Moderate Members) to use these.

## Fun & Utility Commands

- `/quote` — sends a randomized feline quote in Hades’ voice.
- `/fact` — fetches a random cat fact from catfact.ninja.
- `/meme` — posts a cat image/meme from The Cat API.
- `/remind <minutes> <message>` — schedules a reminder directly in the channel after the requested delay.
